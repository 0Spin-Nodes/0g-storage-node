# ZeroG Storage
## Overview 
ZeroG Storage is the storage layer for the ZeroGravity data availability (DA) system. The ZeroG Storage layer holds three important features:

- Buit-in - It is natively built into the ZeroGravity DA system for data storage and retrieval.
- General purpose - It supports to store arbitrary type of data.
- Incentive - Instead of being just a decentralized database, ZeroG Storage introduces PoRA mining algorithm to incentivize storage network participants.
