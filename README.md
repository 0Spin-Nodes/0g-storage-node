# ZeroG Storage

## Overview

ZeroG Storage is the storage layer for the ZeroGravity data availability (DA) system. The ZeroG Storage layer holds three important features:

* Buit-in - It is natively built into the ZeroGravity DA system for data storage and retrieval.
* General purpose - It is designed to support atomic transactions, mutable kv stores as well as archive log systems to enable wide range of applications with various data types.
* Incentive - Instead of being just a decentralized database, ZeroG Storage introduces PoRA mining algorithm to incentivize storage network participants.
